# SearchByStringExtensions

This library is intended to remove the pre-defined way of searches. The traditional way of searching required the user to receive pre-defined entity attributes by which he could perform certain searches. This library has the task of enabling not only developers but also ordinary users to easily and quickly define and use their search queries.

# Installation
